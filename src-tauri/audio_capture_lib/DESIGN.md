# Audio Capture Library Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for the audio capture library that encapsulates the Core Audio functionality from the AudioTapSample project.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Types Module** (`types.rs`)
   - Defines all data structures and enums
   - Provides error types and result types
   - Platform-agnostic interfaces

2. **Device Enumerator** (`device_enumerator.rs`)
   - Platform-agnostic trait for device discovery
   - Factory function for creating platform-specific implementations
   - Utility functions for filtering and sorting devices

3. **Capture Engine** (`capture_engine.rs`)
   - Main interface for audio capture operations
   - Callback-based architecture for receiving audio data
   - Async/await support for non-blocking operations

4. **Audio Processor** (`audio_processor.rs`)
   - Audio processing utilities (resampling, format conversion)
   - Audio analysis functions (RMS, peak detection, silence detection)
   - Format conversion utilities

5. **Platform-Specific Modules** (`macos/`, `windows/`, etc.)
   - Platform-specific implementations of the core traits
   - Direct integration with native audio APIs

### Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Platform-specific code is isolated from the main interface
2. **Async-First**: All operations are designed to be non-blocking
3. **Callback-Based**: Audio data is delivered through callbacks for flexibility
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for different failure modes
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new platforms and capture methods

## Core Audio Integration Plan

- Use `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` with loopback mode
- Handle system audio routing

### Phase 4: Audio Taps ðŸ“‹
- Implement audio tap creation and management
- Use `CATapDescription` and related APIs
- Handle process-specific audio capture

### Phase 5: Aggregate Devices ðŸ“‹
- Implement aggregate device creation
- Combine multiple audio sources
- Handle complex audio routing scenarios

## Integration with Tauri

### Current Approach
The library is designed to integrate seamlessly with Tauri applications:

1. **As a Local Crate**: The library is included as a local dependency in the Tauri project
2. **Callback Integration**: Audio data is delivered through callbacks that can emit Tauri events
3. **Async Support**: All operations are async and work well with Tauri's async runtime
4. **Error Handling**: Errors are properly propagated to the Tauri frontend

### Migration Strategy
The integration is designed to allow gradual migration from the current implementation:

1. **Parallel Implementation**: New library functions can coexist with current code
2. **Feature Parity**: Library provides the same functionality as current implementation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Tauri commands can be gradually replaced
4. **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently

## Conclusion

This design provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive audio capture library that can encapsulate the sophisticated Core Audio functionality from the AudioTapSample project. The modular architecture allows for gradual implementation and testing, while the async-first design ensures good performance in Tauri applications.

The library is designed to be both powerful and easy to use, providing high-level abstractions while maintaining access to low-level audio capabilities when needed.
